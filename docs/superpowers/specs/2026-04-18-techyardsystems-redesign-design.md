## 1. Overview

### What we're building

A full-parity redesign of techyardsystems.com as a production-ready Next.js 15 (App Router) application. The client, Techyard Systems, builds custom AI agents for mid-to-large enterprise workflow automation — customer support, sales lead generation, IT/HR request management, data analysis, and operations/logistics monitoring.

The new site replaces the current one across nine top-level pages plus two dynamic route templates (case study detail, journal post). It is a marketing site — no authenticated product surface, no user accounts, no database.

### Why

The current site is generic B2B SaaS in appearance: blue gradients, icon grids, template-like hero sections. It does not differentiate Techyard Systems from the saturated field of AI-agent vendors who all look visually identical. The redesign commits to an **Editorial Minimal** aesthetic — serif headlines, warm off-white stone palette, italic accent phrasing — that positions Techyard Systems as a thoughtful practice rather than a vendor, and makes the site visually distinctive in the category.

### Success criteria

1. **Visual distinctiveness** — the site should not pass the "AI made this" test. A visitor should not be able to identify the site as templated or AI-generated within three seconds.
2. **Credibility signal surface** — case studies and the practice-based services layout should be the strongest signals on the site, not logos or metric-banner-cards.
3. **Lighthouse baselines in production:** Performance ≥ 95, Accessibility = 100, Best Practices ≥ 95, SEO = 100. CLS < 0.05, LCP < 2.0s on 3G-like conditions.
4. **WCAG 2.2 AA conformance** — verified via axe + manual VoiceOver walkthrough before launch.
5. **Zero-friction content updates** — adding a case study or journal post requires only committing one MDX file; no schema migration, no rebuild required beyond ISR.

### Brand naming (hard rule, CI-enforced)

The brand is **Techyard Systems**, never "Techyard" alone. Every production surface — navigation, footer, page titles, OpenGraph tags, schema.org markup, wordmark, meta descriptions — must use the full name. "Techyard" is acceptable only in internal notes and is explicitly disallowed in shipped code and copy.

**Enforcement:** a CI step runs `rg '\bTechyard\b(?!\s+Systems)' --glob '!docs/**' --glob '!*.md' --glob '!**/node_modules/**' app/ components/ content/ public/ lib/` and fails the build on any match. Adding a genuine exception (a class name, for example) requires an inline `# allow-techyard-short` comment that the matcher ignores. The check runs on every PR — no human has to remember.

## 2. Scope and non-goals

### In scope (V1)

**Static pages:**
- `/` — Home
- `/services` — Services (5 practices, deep)
- `/about` — About (team, philosophy, values)
- `/contact` — Contact (form + Calendly + direct email)
- `/security` — Security & Compliance (FAQ + badges)
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy (MDX)
- `/terms` — Terms of Service (MDX)

**Dynamic content:**
- `/work` — Case studies index (filterable by industry)
- `/work/[slug]` — Case study detail (MDX-driven)
- `/journal` — Journal index
- `/journal/[slug]` — Journal post (MDX-driven)

**API routes:**
- `POST /api/contact` — validates + sends via Resend
- `GET /api/og/[...slug]` — dynamic OpenGraph image generation

**SEO/GEO assets:**
- `/sitemap.xml`
- `/robots.txt`
- `/llms.txt`
- JSON-LD structured data on every page

**Placeholder content (written by implementer in brand voice):**
- All page copy
- Wordmark treatment in Newsreader (client can supply refined logo later)
- Three realistic case studies with fabricated metrics, clearly flagged as placeholder
- Five journal posts (initial content)
- Team member placeholders (client provides real bios + photos)

**Sequencing note — "V1 build" vs "V1 launch":**
- **V1 build** (shipped to staging / Vercel preview for client review) = structure and placeholder content in place, fully functional. Acceptable to ship placeholders into preview deploys.
- **V1 launch** (DNS cut to production) = placeholders **must** be replaced with client-approved copy. The §11.1 pre-launch checklist gates on this. The current site stays live until the replacement copy lands.
- This sequencing means the implementer ships fast into preview (placeholder-OK), and the copy pass happens in parallel with client review — not blocking engineering.

### Non-goals (explicit V1 exclusions)

- **No CMS integration.** Content lives as MDX files in the repo. Migration to Sanity/Contentful/Payload is a V2 decision.
- **No search.** Small site; filters on `/work` and CMD+F are sufficient.
- **No dark mode.** Tokens are structured to support it, but V1 ships light-only.
- **No internationalization.** English only.
- **No authentication, user accounts, or database.**
- **No cookie banner** (Plausible is privacy-first and cookie-less; no banner legally required).
- **No blog commenting system.**
- **No newsletter signup in V1** (can add post-launch if client requests).
- **No live chat widget.**

├── /robots.txt ................. Built-in Next.js generator

```

### URL naming decisions

- `/work` (not `/case-studies`) — shorter, consultancy voice, better share-ability.
- `/journal` (not `/blog`) — editorial tone, fits publication aesthetic.
- `/security` (not `/trust-center`) — plain language, anti-marketing-speak.

### Primary navigation

Five elements: `Work · Services · Journal · About · [Book a call]` CTA. One CTA in nav — no duplicate buttons. Nav is sticky, translucent stone (`rgba(241,237,228,0.88)` with backdrop blur), border-bottom hairline on scroll.

### Rendering strategy

- **Fully static (SSG)** for every page including `/work/[slug]` and `/journal/[slug]`. Since MDX lives in the repo, every content commit triggers a Vercel deploy with a full rebuild — there's no second path by which content could change, so ISR has no work to do and we don't use it. Adding `revalidate: 3600` without a mechanism to change content out-of-band would be theatre; we cut the theatre.
- **Dynamic** only for `/api/og/[...slug]` (edge image generation) and the contact form server action.
- **Future migration to ISR** is trivial if V2 introduces an out-of-band editor (CMS, admin UI). Until then, `pnpm build` is the revalidation mechanism.

## 4. Visual system

### 4.1 Color tokens

All colors defined as CSS custom properties in `styles/tokens.css`; Tailwind v4 reads them via `@theme`.

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-paper` | `#F1EDE4` | Primary page background (Stone) |
| `--color-paper-raised` | `#FFFAF0` | Cards, raised surfaces |
| `--color-ink` | `#2A2F26` | Primary text, dark sections, primary button (Charcoal) |
| `--color-ink-muted` | `#6B7165` | Secondary text, captions (Moss) |
| `--color-ink-subtle` | `#8A7F6B` | Meta text, dates, tertiary labels (Walnut) |
| `--color-accent` | `#4A6152` | Italic accent, links, eyebrow labels, focus ring (Sage) |
| `--color-rule` | `#E3DCCD` | Dividers, subtle borders (Flax) |
| `--color-ink-deep` | `#1A1D18` | Footer background, optional dark-mode base (Obsidian) |

**Contrast verification:**
- Charcoal on Stone: 11.8:1 (AAA)
- Moss on Stone: 5.1:1 (AA)
- Sage on Stone: 5.3:1 (AA)
- Sage on Charcoal: 2.2:1 — **decorative use only, never body text**

**Usage rules:**
- Sage appears only as italic accent in headlines, links, eyebrow labels, and the focus ring. It never appears as a button fill, card background, or body text color. Enforcing this rule preserves the editorial character of the system.
- No "success green," "danger red," or "warning yellow" colors. Form states derive from ink weight + sage accent. Destructive confirmations use a bolder ink + explicit text, not a color.

### 4.2 Typography

Two families, both free Google Fonts, loaded via `next/font/google`:

- **Newsreader** (serif, variable `opsz 6..72`) — all headlines, ledes, pull quotes, and journal body text.
- **Space Grotesk** (sans, `400/500/600`) — UI, buttons, body on all non-journal pages, eyebrow labels, meta text.
- **JetBrains Mono** (optional, used only for code blocks in journal posts).

**Fluid type scale** (all use `clamp()` for breakpoint-free responsiveness):

| Role | Family | Size | LH | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display | Newsreader 500 | `clamp(56px, 10vw, 96px)` | 0.98 | -2.4px |
| H1 | Newsreader 500 | `clamp(42px, 6vw, 64px)` | 1.05 | -1.6px |
| H2 | Newsreader 500 | `clamp(32px, 4.5vw, 44px)` | 1.1 | -1px |
| H3 | Newsreader 500 | 28px | 1.2 | -0.5px |
| Lede | Newsreader 400 italic | 22px | 1.4 | — |
| Body (site) | Space Grotesk 400 | 17px | 1.6 | — |
| Body (journal) | Newsreader 400 | 19px | 1.7 | — |
| UI / button | Space Grotesk 500 | 14px | 1.5 | — |
| Eyebrow | Space Grotesk 500 | 11px | 1.4 | 2px uppercase |

**Reading measure:** 66ch max for sans body, 680px column for journal posts.

### 4.2.1 Font loading strategy (load-bearing for LCP budget)

The hero headline is the LCP element on the home page, rendered in Newsreader at 56–96px. Naïve `next/font/google` usage will blow the < 2.0s LCP budget on mobile 4G. All of the following are required:

- **Subset to Latin only** (`subsets: ['latin']`). Newsreader's full character set is large; Latin alone drops the file by roughly 70%.
- **Variable font, axis-restricted.** Import the variable `opsz` variant, `weight: '400 600'` range only (we use 400 italic, 500, and 600 — no need for 300 or 700). `next/font/google` supports axis restriction via `weight` ranges and `axes` options.
- **`display: 'swap'`** so text never goes invisible during the font fetch (FOIT). Accept brief FOUT; mitigate with fallback metric override below.
- **Fallback metric adjustment** via `adjustFontFallback: true` (the default for Google fonts in next/font) — Next.js generates a size-adjusted system-font fallback so FOUT doesn't shift layout. Verify the computed `size-adjust` in DevTools before launch.
- **Preload the Newsreader display weight** — `next/font/google` preloads by default when the font is used in the root layout; confirm the `<link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin>` appears in page HTML.
- **Space Grotesk and JetBrains Mono** use `display: 'swap'` but are NOT preloaded (not on the LCP path).
- **Self-hosted via next/font** — no runtime fetch from `fonts.googleapis.com`. Next.js downloads the file at build, stores in `.next/static/media/`, serves same-origin.

Baseline to verify post-implementation: **home page LCP < 1.8s on Moto G Power / Slow 4G** in Lighthouse. If it regresses above 2.0s, the first suspect is this subsection not being followed.

### 4.3 Spacing scale

8-point base scale plus fluid section padding:

```
--space-xs:      4px
--space-sm:      8px
--space-md:     16px
--space-lg:     24px
--space-xl:     40px
--space-2xl:    64px
--space-3xl:   104px
--space-section: clamp(80px, 12vw, 160px)   // vertical section rhythm
--container:    1180px max-width
```

### 4.4 Radius

Five values, nothing else:
- `--r-none: 0` — rules, hairlines, full-bleed dividers
- `--r-sm: 4px` — inputs, form fields
- `--r-md: 12px` — cards, figures
- `--r-lg: 18px` — large feature panels, heroes
- `--r-pill: 999px` — CTAs, chips

### 4.5 Motion

```
--dur-instant:  80ms   // focus, press
--dur-fast:    180ms   // hover, reveal
--dur-base:    320ms   // page transition
--dur-slow:    520ms   // stagger entrance
--ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(.22, 1, .36, 1)   // entrance default
--ease-out-expo:  cubic-bezier(.16, 1, .3, 1)    // dramatic reveal
```

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` collapses all `--dur-*` to 0ms. No elastic/bounce easing. Motion conveys meaning (entrances, state changes) — decorative-only motion is disallowed.

### 4.6 Interactive states

Five patterns, derived from the palette:

1. **Primary button** — charcoal fill (`--color-ink`), stone text (`--color-paper`), pill radius. Hover: `translateY(-2px)` over 180ms. Active: translate reset + brief scale(0.98).
2. **Secondary button** — transparent fill, 1px charcoal border, charcoal text, pill radius. Hover: fill → charcoal, text → stone.
3. **Ghost button** — transparent fill, no border, charcoal text with 4px underline offset. Used for the "See recent work" pattern next to primary CTAs where a second bordered button would crowd the hero. Hover: underline thickens to 2px.
4. **Text link** — sage color (`--color-accent`), 4px underline offset. Hover: underline thickens to 2px.
5. **Chip (multi-select, used on Contact form)** — idle: stone (`--color-paper`) fill, flax border (`--color-rule`), charcoal text, pill radius. Selected: sage fill (`--color-accent`), stone text, sage border. Focused (keyboard): 2px sage outline with 2px offset, regardless of selected state.

**Focus ring (universal):** `2px solid var(--color-accent)` + 2px offset. Never removed. Never replaced with a box-shadow-only alternative. Applies to buttons, links, chips, form fields, and any custom interactive element.

## 5. Page designs

### 5.1 Home (`/`)

Section order (top to bottom):

1. **Nav** — sticky, translucent stone with backdrop blur
2. **Hero** — eyebrow ("Autonomous systems · est. practice"), display headline ("Agents that actually *work.*"), italic lede, primary + ghost CTAs
3. **Proof strip** — 4-column metrics (68% reduction · 4× faster · 5× ROI · 7+ industries) under a hairline rule, NOT as stat cards
4. **Practices** — numbered list (№ 01–05), H3 headline + description per practice, right-arrow accent, dividing rules
5. **Featured case study** — dark band (charcoal background), split layout: pull quote on left, 3-stat panel on right, "Read the full study →" link
6. **Industries grid** — 4×2 grid of industries with case-study counts, full-bleed with hairline dividers (stones-grid appearance)
7. **How we work** — 3-column phases (Discovery · Build · Handover) with italic step labels
8. **CTA band** — Flax background (`#E3DCCD`), centered headline + italic sub + primary CTA
9. **Footer** — Obsidian background, 4-column grid (brand + sub / practice / company / contact), hairline rule, bottom row

### 5.2 Case study detail (`/work/[slug]`)

Layout:

1. Nav + breadcrumb (Work / Industry / Title)
2. **Hero** — asymmetric: left = eyebrow + display title + italic lede; right = sidebar meta panel (client, industry, engagement weeks, practice, published date)
3. **Stat band** — dark charcoal, renders in one of two layouts based on `outcomes` length (see §6.1):
   - **3-outcome layout** — three equal columns, each with eyebrow + value (italic unit accent) + note.
   - **1-outcome layout ("hero stat")** — single centered column; value renders at `clamp(88px, 14vw, 160px)`, note expands to 44ch for a substantive context paragraph.
4. **Body** — 2-column: left = sticky table of contents (66ch article measure); right = MDX prose with H2 anchors, pull quotes, figures with captions (see §5.2.1)
5. **Next case study** — Flax band with auto-linked "№ N next" or manual `nextSlug` override

Placeholder-friendly: if `clientDisclosed: false`, render "Tier-1 [industry] (disclosed on request)".

### 5.2.1 Image strategy for case studies and journal posts

Authors place assets at `content/case-studies/<slug>/` or `content/journal/<slug>/` (co-located with the MDX). Velite copies them into the public assets pipeline at build. The schema's `Image` type is:

```typescript
type Image = {
  src: string       // path relative to the MDX file, e.g. "./diagram-01.png"
  alt: string       // required — no empty alt allowed for content images
  width: number     // intrinsic pixel width, measured at build
  height: number    // intrinsic pixel height, measured at build
  caption?: string  // optional figure caption
}
```

Velite runs an `asset()` loader that reads the image, measures dimensions, emits an optimized copy to `.velite/static/`, and rewrites `src` to the public URL. The MDX `<Figure>` component accepts an `Image` object and renders `next/image` with `sizes` appropriate to the 66ch content column (case studies) or 680px column (journal), producing AVIF + WebP variants automatically.

Rules:
- All content images pass through `<Figure>` — raw `<img>` in MDX is disallowed (lint rule).
- Alt text is required at schema level (zod refine). Decorative-only images don't belong in content MDX; they live in `public/` and get `alt=""` inline.
- Feature image on journal posts uses the same `Image` type as inline figures.

### 5.3 Journal post (`/journal/[slug]`)

Layout:

1. Nav + thin obsidian top band ("Techyard Systems · Journal № N")
2. **Centered header** — category chip, display title, italic subtitle, author + reading time + date
3. **Feature image** — 16:9 full-width (minus container margins), 18px radius, `next/image` AVIF+WebP; optional (null in frontmatter = no image)
4. **Body** — 680px column, serif body at 19px, drop cap on first paragraph (CSS `::first-letter`), pull quotes, code blocks (JetBrains Mono on Obsidian)
   - **Drop cap accessibility:** `::first-letter` is styled via CSS only, which means screen readers read the paragraph normally (they do not re-announce the first letter separately). This is acceptable behavior per WCAG 2.2. We do not wrap the first letter in a `<span aria-hidden>` — that would require parsing the MDX-rendered paragraph at runtime and is unnecessary. We do ensure the first paragraph does not begin with an emoji or multi-byte character (authorial rule), as `::first-letter` behavior with those is undefined across browsers.
5. **Author signature** — avatar + name + role, hairline-separated
6. **Related posts** — Flax band, 3-column grid, auto-selected by category or manually via `relatedSlugs`

### 5.4 Services (`/services`)

Hero + deep-dive practice list (reuses homepage practice pattern but with right-column meta: typical timeline, best-fit criteria, measurable-by outcome). Each practice gets tags for integrations (Zendesk, HubSpot, Okta, etc.). CTA band at bottom.

### 5.5 About (`/about`)

Editorial split: left = narrative paragraph and lede; right = values grid (4 cards: "Own the outcome," "No lock-in," "Ship in weeks," "Tell the truth"). Below: team grid (2×N, avatar + name + role). CTA band at bottom.

### 5.6 Contact (`/contact`)

Two-column:

- **Left (primary):** form — name, email, company, practice-interest chips (multi-select), message textarea, submit button. Form submits via the `submitContactForm` server action (see §7.3). Honeypot field hidden. Success state replaces form with thank-you message. Error state (delivery failure) falls back to "Something went wrong — write to contactus@techyardsystems.com instead" with the address clickable.
- **Right (sidebar):** Calendly card (Flax bg) using the **lazy-load-on-click** pattern — see "Calendly & cookies" below. Direct contact info (email, response time, based-in).

**Chips ARIA pattern (custom, Radix has no primitive for this):**

The practice-interest chips are a multi-select input. Implemented as:

```jsx
<fieldset>
  <legend>Which practice are you curious about?</legend>
  <div role="group" aria-labelledby="practice-legend">
    {options.map(opt => (
      <button
        type="button"
        role="checkbox"
        aria-checked={selected.includes(opt.id)}
        onClick={() => toggle(opt.id)}
      >
        {opt.label}
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

Each chip is a `role="checkbox"` button with `aria-checked` state, inside a `role="group"` with a `<legend>`-associated label. Screen readers announce "checkbox, checked" / "checkbox, not checked" per chip, matching user mental model. Space/Enter toggles. Tab moves through chips (one stop each — they're independent checkboxes, not a radiogroup).

**Calendly &amp; cookies.**

Calendly's embed iframe sets third-party cookies on page load, which would invalidate the "no cookie banner required" claim in §2. V1 handles this with lazy-load-on-click:

1. Sidebar renders a static Flax card with a headline ("Or book directly") and a "Book a 15-min call →" button. No iframe, no script, no cookies.
2. Click → replace card contents with the Calendly iframe (set via `src` on click, not pre-set). Clicking is explicit consent to load a third-party tool.
3. Alternative: link out to `calendly.com/...` in a new tab — simpler, zero cookie concern, slightly worse UX. Keep this as a fallback if lazy-load reveals UX friction.

Document the click-to-load behavior on the page itself so users understand why they're clicking twice.

### 5.7 Security (`/security`)

Hero + 4 category chips (Data handling · Compliance · Model ownership · Access & auth) + FAQ accordion (Radix `Accordion`) + compliance badges grid at bottom (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA-ready, ISO 27001). FAQ content is MDX-backed so updates don't require code changes.

### 5.8 404 and error pages (`not-found.tsx`, `error.tsx`)

Editorial sites lose credibility with default frameworks' "404 Page not found" — the voice break is jarring. Both error surfaces stay in-voice:

**404** — same nav + footer shell, centered content:

- Eyebrow: `Error 404 · Page not found`
- Display headline (Newsreader): `This page isn't one of <em>ours.</em>`
- Italic lede: "It might have moved, or you might have a bad link. Here's what we do have:"
- Three primary links below: `→ Services` · `→ Recent work` · `→ Journal`
- Small text at bottom: "If you got here from one of our emails or documents, please let us know: contactus@techyardsystems.com"

**500 / unexpected error** — same shell:

- Eyebrow: `Error · Something broke`
- Display headline: `We're on it.`
- Italic lede: "Please try again in a minute. If it keeps happening, a two-line email to contactus@techyardsystems.com helps us find the cause."
- Single primary CTA: `Reload this page` (calls Next.js `reset()`)

Both error pages are statically rendered — no dynamic data, no external requests, must work when most of the app is broken.

## 6. Content model

### 6.1 Case study schema

File: `content/case-studies/*.mdx`

```typescript
{
  slug: string                  // from filename
  number: string                // "№ 03"
  clientName: string            // "Tier-1 3PL (disclosed on request)"
  clientDisclosed: boolean      // true = real name; false = anonymized rendering
  industry: IndustryEnum        // logistics | financial | healthcare | saas | ecommerce | pro-services | government | manufacturing
  practice: PracticeEnum        // support | sales | it-hr | data | ops
  engagementWeeks: number
  engagementType: "fixed fee" | "pilot" | "retainer"
  publishedAt: Date
  title: string                 // full display headline
  titleAccent: string           // italic substring of title
  lede: string                  // 1-2 sentence italic summary
  pullQuote: string | null      // optional — for homepage featured
  pullAttribution: string | null
  outcomes: [Outcome, Outcome, Outcome] | [Outcome]  // see "outcome shape" below
  featured: boolean             // appears on homepage
  nextSlug: string | null       // manual "next" override
  body: MDX                     // long-form with H2 anchors
}

type Outcome = {
  eyebrow: string               // "Outcome 01"
  value: string                 // "68"
  valueAccent: string           // "%"  (rendered italic in sage)
  note: string                  // 1-sentence context
}
```

**Outcome shape — exactly 3, or exactly 1.**

The dark stat band renders in one of two layouts, chosen by `outcomes.length`:

- **3 outcomes** → three-column grid (the layout shown in §3 wireframes). Each column: eyebrow + value with italic unit + 1-sentence note.
- **1 outcome** → single centered "hero stat" — value at `clamp(88px, 14vw, 160px)`, note expands to a 44ch paragraph of genuine context. Reserved for engagements where one metric is so decisive that padding to three would weaken the story.

**2 or 4+ outcomes are invalid** and fail the build. The schema enforces this with a zod discriminated union: `z.tuple([Outcome, Outcome, Outcome]).or(z.tuple([Outcome]))`. An attempt to ship two outcomes fails velite validation with a clear error message pointing to the MDX file.

Why not allow arbitrary lengths? The stat band is the signal-carrying element of the page. Bad layouts tank signal. Two options — "three strong metrics in a row" or "one metric so strong it stands alone" — cover every real engagement we've seen without enabling the "four weak stats in a 2×2 grid" failure mode that this constraint exists to prevent.

### 6.2 Journal post schema

File: `content/journal/*.mdx`

```typescript
{
  slug: string
  number: string                // "Journal № 14"
  category: "Field notes" | "Opinion" | "Notes" | "Fieldwork"
  title: string
  titleAccent: string           // italic portion
  subtitle: string
  publishedAt: Date
  readingMinutes: number        // auto-calculated, overridable
  author: Author
  featureImage: Image | null
  body: MDX
  relatedSlugs: string[] | null // manual override; else auto by category
}

type Author = {
  name: string
  role: string
  avatar: Image
}
```

### 6.3 Taxonomies

File: `content/taxonomies.ts`

```typescript
export const industries = [
  "logistics", "financial", "healthcare", "saas",
  "ecommerce", "pro-services", "government", "manufacturing"
] as const;

export const practices = [
  "support", "sales", "it-hr", "data", "ops"
] as const;

export type Industry = typeof industries[number];
export type Practice = typeof practices[number];
```

Adding a new industry/practice = one edit to this file; types propagate everywhere (frontmatter validation, filter UI, TypeScript types).

### 6.4 Home-page content

Stored as a typed TypeScript object (not MDX) at `content/home.ts` — the home page is a fixed composition, not streamed content. MDX is the wrong tool for "hero eyebrow + hero headline + hero lede," so we don't use it.

### 6.5 Velite configuration

`velite.config.ts` scans `content/case-studies/*.mdx` and `content/journal/*.mdx`, validates each with the zod schemas above, and emits `.velite/index.ts` with typed arrays:

```typescript
export const allCaseStudies: CaseStudy[];
export const allJournalPosts: JournalPost[];
```

Pages import from `.velite/` — not from raw MDX. A missing required field fails `pnpm build` with a precise error; no broken content reaches production.

- `@playwright/test` — E2E + visual regression
- `eslint`, `eslint-config-next`, `@typescript-eslint/*`

- `lighthouse-ci` — CI performance budgets

Explicitly *not* included: `shadcn/ui` (aesthetic mismatch), `date-fns` or `dayjs` (Intl.DateTimeFormat suffices), state managers, ORM, form libraries beyond what zod + React native forms provide.

### 7.3 Data flow

**Content → pages.**
1. Author commits an MDX file to `content/`.
2. `pnpm build` runs velite; velite validates frontmatter with zod, compiles MDX body, writes `.velite/index.ts`.
3. Pages import `allCaseStudies` / `allJournalPosts` at module level.
4. `generateStaticParams()` emits every `[slug]` at build.
5. ISR `revalidate: 3600` lets pushes hit production in ~2 minutes.

**Contact form flow.**

The form uses a single submission path — React 19 server action — not a parallel `POST /api/contact` route. We expose one mechanism; no drift, no duplicate validation logic.

1. `/contact` renders `<ContactForm />` as a client component (client island — the rest of the page is RSC).
2. Submit fires `useActionState(submitContactForm, initialState)`.
3. `submitContactForm` is a server action (`'use server'`) co-located in `app/contact/actions.ts`. It:
   - Zod-validates the FormData against the contact schema
   - Returns `{ ok: false, kind: 'validation', fieldErrors }` on validation failure (React re-renders form with inline errors)
   - Honeypot + timing check (if tripped → return `{ ok: true }` silently; do not email, do not tell the bot)
   - Calls Resend directly (no intermediate route handler):
     - Admin email → `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` (full submission, reply-to = submitter)
     - Confirmation auto-reply → submitter, `From: RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
   - On Resend error (timeout, 5xx, rate-limit): log to stderr (Vercel logs) via a structured logger, and return `{ ok: false, kind: 'delivery' }` to the client
   - Returns `{ ok: true }` on success → form replaces with thank-you state

4. **Error UX branches:**
   - `kind: 'validation'` → inline errors per field, focus first invalid field.
   - `kind: 'delivery'` → replace the form with a fallback panel: "Something went wrong on our end — please write to us at **contactus@techyardsystems.com** instead. We read every message." Include a `mailto:` link with the user's message pre-populated as the body so their work isn't lost. Log client-visible error code to Plausible as a custom event so delivery failures are observable.
   - Network errors (submission never reached the action) → browser's native form error surface + retry suggestion.

5. **Bot mitigation:** honeypot hidden input (`website`) rejected server-side; timing check rejects submits under 1.5s. If abuse materializes post-launch, add Upstash Redis + sliding-window rate-limit (10 submits / IP / hour) gated inside the action — we do not add a route-handler wrapper.

6. **Observability:** server action failures log to Vercel function logs (structured JSON). No Sentry / external error tracker in V1 (YAGNI for a single form on a marketing site). If we ever add one, it goes in `lib/logger.ts` as a single swap. Plausible custom events: `contact_submit_success`, `contact_submit_validation_error`, `contact_submit_delivery_error` — enough signal without being noisy.

**OG image flow.**
1. Page's `generateMetadata()` sets `openGraph.images: [/api/og/work/[slug]]`.
2. Request to `/api/og/[...slug]` — edge route looks up slug, renders `<div>` tree to PNG via `@vercel/og` using Newsreader-on-Stone composition.
3. Vercel caches forever (immutable URL per slug).

### 7.4 Build & deploy

- Hosted on **Vercel**.
- Preview deployments per branch (critical for client approvals during build). **Preview deploys are `noindex, nofollow` and password-protected** via Vercel's built-in access control — see §11.1. This prevents fabricated placeholder metrics from being crawled and indexed before real copy lands.
- Production domain at `techyardsystems.com`.
- Old site preserved at `old.techyardsystems.com` for 30 days post-launch as rollback insurance.

**Environment variables (complete list):**

| Variable | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Server | Resend API authentication |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | Server | `From:` address on outbound email (e.g., `noreply@techyardsystems.com`) — must be verified in Resend dashboard |
| `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` | Server | Destination for admin notifications (`contactus@techyardsystems.com`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` | Client | Plausible site domain (client-side script needs it) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Client | Canonical site URL for OG/canonical/JSON-LD builders |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY_URL` | Client | Calendly scheduling URL (used in the lazy-load iframe src) |
| `VERCEL_ENV` | Server | Provided by Vercel; used to gate noindex on preview deploys |

All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked into the client bundle at build. `.env.example` committed to repo documents the variables without values.

### 7.5 Security headers

Configured in `next.config.ts` via `headers()`:

```typescript
const securityHeaders = [
  { key: 'Strict-Transport-Security', value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload' },
  { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
  { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
  { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
  { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()' },
  { key: 'Content-Security-Policy', value: csp },
];
```

**CSP (Content-Security-Policy):**

```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{{random}}' plausible.io;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';  // required for next/font generated CSS
img-src 'self' data: blob:;
font-src 'self';
connect-src 'self' plausible.io;
frame-src calendly.com *.calendly.com;  // only when user clicks to load
form-action 'self';
base-uri 'self';
frame-ancestors 'none';
```

`'unsafe-inline'` on `style-src` is a pragmatic concession to Next.js + next/font generated styles; we can tighten to nonce-based later if CSP reporting shows it's safe. `frame-src` is scoped to Calendly — any other third-party iframe requires an explicit CSP amendment (good: forces a decision, not an accident).

A reporting endpoint (`report-uri` / `report-to`) is not configured in V1 — revisit if we want to instrument CSP violations later.

**`/security.txt` and `SECURITY.md`:**

- `public/.well-known/security.txt` at the well-known path per RFC 9116, with `Contact:` and `Expires:` fields.
- `SECURITY.md` at repo root with responsible-disclosure policy. Links from `/security` page.

A site called `/security` selling to enterprises without either of these is a visible credibility gap. Both are trivial additions in V1.

## 8. SEO and GEO strategy

### 8.1 Per-page metadata

Every page implements `generateMetadata()` returning:
- `title` + `description` (from frontmatter or static config)
- `canonical` URL
- `openGraph` — `url`, `title`, `description`, `images: [og-api-url]`, `type`
- `twitter` — `card: summary_large_image`, same image

### 8.2 Structured data (JSON-LD)

Injected per page type via helper functions in `lib/seo.ts`:

- **Home + About** — `Organization` with `name`, `url`, `sameAs`, `contactPoint`, `foundingDate`
- **Services** — `Service` schema per practice, nested under Organization
- `/work/[slug]` — `Article` (schema.org has no native `CaseStudy` type) with `about` referencing the practice and `mentions` referencing the industry; include `datePublished`, `author`, `articleBody`, `headline`, `image` (OG image URL)
- `/journal/[slug]` — `BlogPosting` (subclass of `Article`) with `Person` author, `datePublished`, `wordCount`, `articleBody`, `keywords` from category
- `/security` — `FAQPage` with `Question`/`Answer` pairs

### 8.3 Dynamic OpenGraph images

`@vercel/og` renders a unique OG card per page: Newsreader serif title on Stone background with Techyard Systems wordmark and sage accent underline. Each card is unique per page title — dramatically improves LinkedIn share CTR vs. a static card.

### 8.4 Sitemap + robots + llms.txt

- `app/sitemap.ts` — generates from all static routes + all MDX slugs. Each entry has `lastModified`, `changeFrequency`, and `priority`. Google ignores `priority`/`changefreq` but Bing still honors them; since we submit to both (§11.2), populating them is effectively free upside. Rough assignments: `/` = 1.0 / weekly, `/work/*` = 0.8 / monthly, `/journal/*` = 0.7 / monthly, legal pages = 0.3 / yearly.
- `app/robots.ts` — allow all, reference sitemap, no AI-crawler blocks.
- `public/llms.txt` — canonical summary + pointers to key pages. Signals to ChatGPT web search, Perplexity, Claude web for citation eligibility.

### 8.5 Redirects

`next.config.ts` permanent redirects from old site's URLs:
- `/case-studies/*` → `/work/*`
- `/blog/*` → `/journal/*`
- Any specific legacy URLs captured from the current sitemap

---

## 9. Accessibility commitments

Target: **WCAG 2.2 AA**, verified not assumed.

- **Color contrast** pre-verified per §4.1 token table; tokens lint at review time.
- **Focus indicators**: 2px sage ring + 2px offset on every interactive surface. Never `outline: none` without a replacement.
- **Keyboard navigation**: logical tab order, skip-to-main link first focusable on every page.
- **Semantic HTML first**; ARIA only where semantics are insufficient (Radix-backed accordion + dialog).
- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — all `--dur-*` collapse to 0ms. Non-essential entrance motion suppressed.
- **Images**: `next/image` with meaningful `alt`; decorative backgrounds `alt=""`.
- **Forms**: visible `<label>` per field (not placeholder-only), inline error via `aria-describedby`, focus first invalid field on submit failure, `aria-live="polite"` for async states.
- **Heading hierarchy**: h1 per page, sequential h2..h6 with no skipped levels.
- **Screen-reader pass before launch** — VoiceOver (Safari macOS/iOS) + NVDA (Windows Firefox) manual walkthrough of home, case study detail, journal post, contact form.

---

## 10. Testing strategy

### 10.1 Unit / integration

- **Vitest** for `lib/` utilities (MDX helpers, SEO builders, form validators).
- Target: meaningful coverage of business logic, not line-count coverage.

### 10.2 Content validation

- **velite + zod** = primary content test. Bad frontmatter fails `pnpm build`.

### 10.3 End-to-end

- **Playwright**, ~13 flows:
  1. Home loads; proof strip values render
  2. Nav links work + sticky nav behaves
  3. Contact form submits (Resend mocked success) and success state renders
  4. Contact form fails validation with inline errors for missing required fields
  5. Contact form delivery-failure path renders fallback panel (Resend mocked 500) with `mailto:` link populated
  6. Case study page renders with ToC + stat band in both the 3-outcome and 1-outcome layouts (two fixtures)
  7. Journal post renders with drop cap + related posts
  8. 404 page renders for bad slug with in-voice editorial copy (not default framework 404)
  9. `prefers-reduced-motion` suppresses entrance motion
  10. Keyboard-only: full nav path reaches every link + form field + submit; chips toggle with Space/Enter
  11. `sitemap.xml` responds with 200 and valid XML
  12. `/api/og/work/<first-slug>` responds with 200, `Content-Type: image/png`, and non-empty body
  13. Calendly card renders as static button; click loads iframe (catches lazy-load regression)

### 10.4 Visual regression

- **Playwright screenshots** at mobile (375px) + desktop (1440px):
  - `/` (home, full scroll)
  - `/work/[slug]` with 3-outcome layout
  - `/work/[slug]` with 1-outcome layout
  - `/journal/[slug]` (drop-cap paragraph in frame)
  - `/contact`
  - `/not-found` (visit `/nonexistent`)
- **Cross-browser drop-cap check.** The journal post fixture is screenshotted additionally in Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox at the same viewport. `::first-letter` renders differently across engines — this pair catches engine-specific regressions and confirms the drop cap isn't causing FOUT-driven layout shift once Newsreader loads.

### 10.5 Performance budgets (CI-enforced)

- Lighthouse CI on every PR:
  - Performance ≥ 95
  - Accessibility = 100
  - Best Practices ≥ 95
  - SEO = 100
  - CLS < 0.05
  - LCP < 2.0s (mobile, 4G)

## 11. Launch and rollback plan

### 11.1 Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel production (full list in §7.4)
- [ ] Custom domain + SSL configured
- [ ] Favicons (multi-size) + `apple-touch-icon` + `manifest.json`
- [ ] `next.config.ts` redirects from legacy paths (`/case-studies/*` → `/work/*`, `/blog/*` → `/journal/*`)
- [ ] Plausible tracking verified + goals set (`contact_submit_success`, `contact_submit_delivery_error`, Calendly click)
- [ ] **DNS TTL reduced to 300s at least 48 hours before the DNS cut** — this is the window resolver caches need to drain; same-day reduction doesn't help us
- [ ] All placeholder copy replaced with client-approved copy (see V1 build vs V1 launch note in §2)
- [ ] All fabricated case-study metrics replaced with real (or genuinely-representative-and-labeled-as-illustrative) figures
- [ ] Wordmark finalized (or client-supplied logo wired in)
- [ ] Journal cadence owner named; first 90-day editorial calendar filled with at least 3 committed future posts — otherwise the journal actively signals the opposite of the practice voice it's meant to project
- [ ] Preview deploys set to `noindex, nofollow` + Vercel password protection — verified with a `curl` against a preview URL before launch day
- [ ] Security headers verified with securityheaders.com or Mozilla Observatory (target: A grade)
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` + `/.well-known/security.txt` present and valid
- [ ] Final axe audit passing
- [ ] Final VoiceOver walkthrough recorded/signed off
- [ ] Production Lighthouse run meeting budgets
- [ ] `llms.txt` reviewed and matches live content structure
- [ ] OG images preview correctly on LinkedIn + Twitter + iMessage (manual paste-test)
- [ ] `/api/og/work/<any-slug>` returns 200 in production (Playwright already tests it in CI)
- [ ] Brand-name lint (§1) passing on the `main` branch with no allow-comments

### 11.2 Launch

1. Deploy to Vercel production.
2. Keep old site live at `old.techyardsystems.com` (CNAME to current host).
3. DNS cut `techyardsystems.com` A/AAAA to Vercel.
4. Submit new sitemap to Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools.
5. Verify Plausible is tracking.

### 11.3 Rollback

- **Pre-requisite (T-minus 48h):** DNS TTL on the `techyardsystems.com` A/AAAA records reduced to 300s **at least 48 hours before the cut**. This is not optional and not same-day — resolver caches retain the previous TTL (typically 3600s+) until that cache expires, so a same-day TTL change is ineffective. The 48h window lets existing resolver caches drain.
- **If a critical production issue appears** (form completely broken, hero failing to render, performance regression > 20%, CSP blocking critical functionality):
  - DNS cut-back to `old.techyardsystems.com`'s origin takes 5–15 minutes with the pre-reduced TTL in place.
  - Keep rollback option live for 30 days. After 30 days, `old.techyardsystems.com` is retired.
- Lesser issues (typos, small layout bugs) fix-forward on the new site via redeploy.
- **Rollback is an operational last resort, not a routine.** A rollback after a few hours of production traffic loses any form submissions received on the new site unless we explicitly forward them. Practice fix-forward for anything non-critical.

---

## 12. Out-of-scope items (for V2 consideration)

Not implemented in V1 but explicitly considered:

- Headless CMS migration (Sanity or Payload) — trigger if content team grows beyond dev-led editing. When this happens, also switch `/work/*` and `/journal/*` to ISR with on-demand revalidation (see §3 rendering strategy — we dropped ISR in V1 precisely because it's unnecessary until an out-of-band editor exists).
- Dark mode — tokens already support; UI toggle is the only missing piece
- Newsletter signup + email capture
- Search across `/journal` + `/work` (Pagefind or Algolia)
- i18n (additional locales if Techyard Systems expands geographically)
- Blog RSS feed
- Video case studies embedded in `/work/[slug]`
- **Inbound webhook endpoint** (`app/api/contact/route.ts`) — V1's server-action-only submission path cannot be called from non-browser contexts. If V2 integrates Zapier, HubSpot, or any inbound webhook that wants to create a contact record, we'll need a parallel `POST /api/contact` route handler with its own auth (Bearer token or HMAC). The server action stays the primary form path; the route handler becomes a non-form caller. Flagging now so it's not a surprise discovery during a V2 integration scoping.
- CSP reporting endpoint — collect `report-uri` violations to tighten the `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` concession in §7.5
- Sentry or similar external error tracking — V1 uses Vercel function logs; V2 adds structured error tracking when traffic justifies it.

## 13. Open questions (flagged before spec review)

None as of 2026-04-18. All decisions documented above were validated with the stakeholder during brainstorming. This section exists to be populated if spec review surfaces gaps.

---

## 14. Glossary

- **SSG** — Static Site Generation. Page rendered at build time, served as static HTML.
- **ISR** — Incremental Static Regeneration. Next.js pattern that rebuilds individual static pages on a schedule or on-demand without a full redeploy.
- **MDX** — Markdown + JSX. Plain-text content format with component embeds, used here for case studies and journal posts.
- **Velite** — MDX + zod content pipeline; successor to contentlayer.
- **GEO** — Generative Engine Optimization. SEO for AI-answer engines (ChatGPT web, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini).
- **`llms.txt`** — Emerging standard at site root that summarizes the site for AI crawlers.
